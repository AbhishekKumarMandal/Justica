# Justica

Justica will help both groups by connecting them together. By using Justica, solo
lawyers have the opportunity to find new clients and people who are looking for a
lawyer, can easily find one which matches their criteria.
So, we are going to take the registrations using different login and signup forms for both
clients and lawyers. Client authenticity is verified by his/her Aadhar Card number and
Lawyers through their unique code/ssn provided to them by court or institutions they
have studied from.
Taking our implementation to the next level, after login by client, there is a dashboard
where he can see the active leads, questions he/she has previously asked and also
there is a panel to take input for new issues. At the first place, client needs to choose
the field in which he wants to ask questions and seek answers from fellow Lawyers.
Then, he needs to upload the issue framed in standard docs/pdf. 
Best part starts here, we are planning to use Natural language processing algorithm at
the backend for our Jusitca database to make recommendations to the client based on
the keywords extracted form the submitted issues by the client by running our machine
learning and data models on the whole document. This recommendation is based on
matching document keywords and the preferred specialist Lawyer in that field. Not only
the maching keywords but it also depends on the rating of the Lawyers based on earlier
feedback submitted by clients and their experience with them.This enables the Client to
make a choice that is transparent and also helps him to connect with the desired lawyer
with the help of our machine learning model.
